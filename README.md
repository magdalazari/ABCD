Data from: ABCD cognition -> NIH Toolbox (5 administered at baseline, 2nd and 4th year, all of them were administered in English)
Tests included: 
1. Picture Vocabulary (component of the Crystallized Composite Score)
2. Flanker Inhibitory Control & Attention (component of the Fluid Composite Score) (remote assessments used a replicated Flanker task -Inquisit platform-)
3. Picture Sequence Memory (component of the Fluid Composite Score)
4. Pattern Comparison Processing Speed (component of the Fluid Composite Score)
5. Oral Reading Recognition (component of the Crystallized Composite Score)

6. Number of participants included/event: baseline: 11868, 2-year follow-up:	10973, 4-year follow-up: 4754.

the Little man task was also administered in baseline, 2nd and 4th year, but: when administered in the baseline assessment a customized program designed by ABCD was used, whereas the 2-year and 4-year follow-up assessments a task presented in the Inquisit system from Millisecond was used. 

Questions/to do's: 
1. Remote assessments in the 2-year and 4-year follow-up protocols used a Flanker task using the Inquisit system from Millisecond. This task was designed to mimic the NIH Toolbox Flanker task as closely as possible, but should I keep the test?
2. I must find a way to exclude the subjects that did not take part in measurements 2 and 3 (do I though?)
3. I should test/look up the little man task
4. Maybe the file nc_y_flkr has more answers (on the millisecond task), I get an error though. It is only in times 2 and 3, so it is still useless but has mean response times for some versions of the task) 
5. WISC has no wm tests
6. 	tfmri_nb_all_beh_c0b_mrt=Average reaction time for all correct responses to 0 back stimuli during run 1 and run 2
7. 	tfmri_nb_all_beh_c2b_mrt=Average reaction time for all correct responses to 2 back stimuli during run 1 and run 2
