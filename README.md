Data from: ABCD cognition -> NIH Toolbox (5 administered at baseline, 2nd and 4th year, all of them were administered in English)
Tests included: 
1. Picture Vocabulary (component of the Crystallized Composite Score)
2. Flanker Inhibitory Control & Attention (component of the Fluid Composite Score) (remote assessments used a replicated Flanker task -Inquisit platform-)
3. Picture Sequence Memory (component of the Fluid Composite Score)
4. Pattern Comparison Processing Speed (component of the Fluid Composite Score)
5. Oral Reading Recognition (component of the Crystallized Composite Score)

6. Number of participants included/event: baseline: 11868, 2-year follow-up:	10973, 4-year follow-up: 4754.

the Little man task was also administered in baseline, 2nd and 4th year, but: when administered in the baseline assessment a customized program designed by ABCD was used, whereas the 2-year and 4-year follow-up assessments a task presented in the Inquisit system from Millisecond was used. 

Questions/to do's: 
1. What is the difference between: age corrected, uncorrected, raw, theta, computed, fully-corrected T-score? (ABCD recommends using uncorrected scale or raw scores)
2. Remote assessments in the 2-year and 4-year follow-up protocols used a Flanker task using the Inquisit system from Millisecond. This task was designed to mimic the NIH Toolbox Flanker task as closely as possible, but should I keep the test?
3. I must find a way to exclude the subjects that did not take part in measurements 2 and 3.
4. Is the MCAR test useful to address the missing data?
5. Find a way to summarise/visualise each columns values (to see how many are not available).
6. I found the excel that describes the visit types for each participant/wave: 1 = In person, 2 = Remote, 3 = Hybrid
