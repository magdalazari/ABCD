Data from: ABCD cognition -> NIH Toolbox (5 administered at baseline, 2nd and 4th year)
Tests included: 
1. Picture Vocabulary (component of the Crystallized Composite Score)
2. Flanker Inhibitory Control & Attention (component of the Fluid Composite Score) (remote assessments used a replicated Flanker task -Inquisit platform-)
3. 3. Picture Sequence Memory (component of the Fluid Composite Score)
4. Pattern Comparison Processing Speed (component of the Fluid Composite Score)
5. Oral Reading Recognition (component of the Crystallized Composite Score)

the Little man task was also administered in baseline, 2nd and 4th year, so maybe could also be included? 

Questions: 
1. What is the difference between: age corrected, uncorrected, raw, theta, computed, fully-corrected T-score? (ABCD recommends using uncorrected scale or raw scores)
2.
